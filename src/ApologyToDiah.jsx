              `Hi Diah,\n
I know I havenâ€™t been fair to someone who gave me warmth and attention.\n
Without realizing it, Iâ€™ve hurt you with my arrogance, harsh words, and presence that brought pain instead of comfort.\n
I want you to knowâ€¦ Iâ€™m truly sorry.\n
Iâ€™m trying to grow, to become a better version of myself.\n
But today, more than anything, I just want to say: I'm sorry!!.\n
I miss your sweet and warm self ðŸ˜”.\n
The way you cared, your calm presence.. I miss all of it.\n
Iâ€™m sorry for the wounds I caused.\n
Iâ€™m sorry for the moments you deserved understanding, but I gave judgment instead.\n
I'm sorry for the anger and harsh words, you didn't deserve that ðŸ˜­.\n
If thereâ€™s still space in your heartâ€¦ please let me try to make things right, even if slowly.\n
I hope you know, this apology comes from the deepest part of me.`,
